The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, approximately in the late 36th century. A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance. Within the Galactic Empire, based on mid 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.  
  
In the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen Li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating casualties and damages due to military operations.  
As a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies and narrates the rich history of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: ""There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.""

From the author Eliezer Yudkowsky:
This is not a strict single-point-of-departure fic - there exists a primary point of departure, at some point in the past, but also other alterations. The best term I've heard for this fic is ""parallel universe"".

The text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues, truly obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers successfully decode, and massive evidence left out in plain sight. This is a rationalist story; its mysteries are solvable, and meant to be solved.

All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind that, beyond the realm of science, the views of the characters may not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered by darker characters may be untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.","Time Travel, Comedy, Self-Published, Magic, Doujinshi, Philosophical, School Life, Fantasy, Web Comic, Mystery",6.728,1257,2024

An Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself.

But An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…

When Raphia met her demise after having been used and thrown away by her benefactor, Yuri, she went back nine years in the past.

‘I’m not going to relive that hell!’

Running away from her benefactor, she went to Kasein Soleia, Yuri’s archnemesis, and signed a new sponsorship contract with him.

“I shall kill every single person you despise, Milord.”

“The necessary role happens to be open, and you might just be the right person for it.”

Young Duke. This is a sponsorship contract, right? But why . . . why are we getting married?

===

“Throughout the time I won’t be by your side . . . I will think of nothing but your small, cute head.”

That low voice sent shivers down her spine.

“I can’t believe you’re leaving. I’ll just . . .”

Kasein looked at her sharply as if he was daring her to continue making up excuses.

“You have to answer well, brat. Depending on what you say, all the wagon and shoe craftsmen of the Empire might lose their livelihood.”

Despite his harsh words, Kasein’s touch was gentle. He couldn’t take his eyes off of Raphia, who strangely grew more beautiful by the day.

Not found,"The series began as a fairly humorous and lighthearted satire of Japan's teenage delinquent-gang subculture told from the perspective of Matsushita Tadashi (who also narrates these early Karate Bu stories), a 2nd year student at Kangokou High and a constant target of Kangokou's numerous bullies who beat him up routinely after school. He is almost always accompanied by his best friend Saitou Takaki, who is also constantly harassed.  
  
As the pair grow increasingly tired of being victimized they decide to join the titular Karate Club, which is notorious throughout Osaka's youth gangs for training and producing the city's most hardened and toughest teenage thugs while maintaining the facade of a legit school sports club. But when they join the club, they find themselves picked on just as much if not worse by the club's current members. But as the story progresses they grow to be increasingly capable fighters.  
  
Along with the manga's change in attitude and central character, the various teenage fighters throughout the series grew increasingly stronger and even began to tap into superhuman ki abilities, putting Osu!! Karate Bu in the company of other similar epic Shōnen fighting manga such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, and Fist of the North Star.  
  
Osu!! Karate Bu was wildly popular in its native Japan, but is otherwise almost completely unknown in most other countries. It spawned a four episode OVA mini-series released over a period of two years from 1990-1992, a 1990 live action movie, and a 1994 Super Famicom fighting game.","Thriller, Action, Psychological, Comedy, Sports, Martial Arts, Philosophical, Drama, School Life, Slice of Life",7.6786,519,1985

"Kiyoubinbou, Jou wo Tateru ~Kaitaku Gakuen no Rettousei na no ni, Joukyuu-shoku no Skill to Mahou ga Subete Tsukaemasu~","The boy Leopin was born with unnaturally high dexterity. From an early age, he used his dexterity to contribute to his peers in a variety of crafts. Leopin and his friends entered the Royal Pioneer Academy. However, during the ""Ritual of Ability Development"" at the entrance ceremony, the status given to Leopin was disastrous.

""Occupation: Unemployed.""
""All statuses except dexterity remain at their initial values and do not grow.""
""Skill is dexterous, master of none.""

Leopin's classmates exiled him because he had nothing to offer other than his dexterity. Leopin is placed in the ""Special Training Class"", a class for failures. Leopin is left all alone. However, he realizes that the skill he has been given, ""Poor Dexterity,"" has an unexpected performance. That is...

You can convert your dexterity status to any other status.
You can change your occupation to any one you want.

The first thing Leopin did was to become a lumberjack. First, Leopin changed his job to ""Lumberjack"" to get wood from the forest. He then became a carpenter and built the most magnificent house of all. He became an Appraiser to identify rare items, and a Battle Axe User to fight off students from other classes who tried to attack him. Become a Ranger to explore dungeons and a Ninja to get through traps with ease. Leopin, alone (solo), had gained enough power to do everything.

As Leopin continues to be a warrior, he is adored by his childhood friend, a saint, and admired by a beautiful alchemist, and his activities become even more well known. On the other hand, the classmates who expelled Leopin regret their decision to do so when they witness Leopin's abilities. Their home remains a shack, they are unable to explore, and they gradually lose their place in the school and are ruined.

**Explanation:** the skill is not ""poor dexterity"", but ""dexterous poor"", which is the Japanese equivalent to a Jack of all trades, master of none; since they can do a bit of everything, they are ""dexterous"", but since they have mastered none, they supposedly cannot make a living from it, hence they are ""poor"". Another manner of saying you have high dexterity is to be ""handy"", back-translated from DEX as in *manual* dexterity from early RPGs.
